Simple playbooks to install OpenHPC version 2.0 using Ansible. 

See the doc/README.md for a tutorial on using these scripts in a VirtualBox environment.

The Ansible layout is fairly simple, using a series of roles for different parts of the installation process. 

This repo will get you to the point of a working slurm installation across your cluster. It does not 
currently provide any scientific software or user management options! 

The basic usage is to set up the master node with the initial 3 roles (pre\_ohpc,ohpc\_install,ohpc\_config)
and use the rest to build node images, and deploy the actual nodes (these use Warewulf as a provisioner by default). 

Trigger the roles individually via tags, like:

```
ansible-playbook -t pre_ohpc -i inventory/headnode headnode.yml
```

None of these Ansible roles actually touch the compute nodes directly - at most, they build a new vnfs image and
trigger a reboot. 

A more detailed description is available in the /doc folder.
