      - **any** - (*1-28 cores*) Use any available Owens node. This reduces the
        wait time as there are no node requirements.
      - **hugemem** - (*48 cores*) Use an Owens node that has 1.5TB of
        available RAM as well as 48 cores. There are 16 of these nodes on
        Owens.
      - **debug** - (*1-28 cores*) For short sessions (= 1 hour) the debug
        queue will have the shortest wait time. This is only accessible during
        8AM - 6PM, Monday - Friday. There are 6 of these nodes on Owens.
